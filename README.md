# ELECTRONIC CANDLE PROJECT
## Description
Candles are a source of light and warmth as well as a good decorative stuff that all of us are familier with.But the wax candles we use have a short life as they melt away and also require great caution while handling.<br>
A smart solution to this is **An Electronic Candle**.<br>
The electronic candle uses light sensors which detect variation in light intensity in the surrounding.It automatically switches **ON** in low-lit conditions and switches **OFF** in lighted conditions. 
## Materials Required
1. LM358 IC
